# PHP ActiveRecord - Version 1.0 Branch mr74 #

## Changes for Branch mr74.
Changes made for adaptation to existing Phalcon site.
Test cases massaged for PHPUnit version 9.5

Model::find return  null instead of exception, if record not found for 'first' or primary key value.

Model::find with no arguments defaults to 'all'.

Config::get_default_connection  renamed as get_default_name.
Config::get_default_connection_string renamed get_default_connection.

Config connection data can be string or array of parameters.

Model methods create() and update() exist, for Phalcon\Db\Model compatibility,
 even though they only call the save() method.

private methods Model insert and update renamed to p_insert and p_update.

static Model::create renamed to static Model::createInserted, as model object is to be returned as already saved.

static Model::createInserted will not catch a DatabaseException.

## Introduction ##
A brief summarization of what ActiveRecord is:

> Active record is an approach to access data in a database. A database table or view is wrapped into a class,
> thus an object instance is tied to a single row in the table. After creation of an object, a new row is added to
> the table upon save. Any object loaded gets its information from the database; when an object is updated, the
> corresponding row in the table is also updated. The wrapper class implements accessor methods or properties for
> each column in the table or view.

More details can be found [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_record_pattern).

This implementation is inspired and thus borrows heavily from Ruby on Rails' ActiveRecord.
We have tried to maintain their conventions while deviating mainly because of convenience or necessity.
Of course, there are some differences which will be obvious to the user if they are familiar with rails.

## Minimum Requirements ##

- PHP 5.3+
- PDO driver for your respective database

## Supported Databases ##

- MySQL
- SQLite
- PostgreSQL
- Oracle

## Features ##

- Finder methods
- Dynamic finder methods
- Writer methods
- Relationships
- Validations
- Callbacks
- Serializations (json/xml)
- Transactions
- Support for multiple adapters
- Miscellaneous options such as: aliased/protected/accessible attributes

## Installation ##

Setup is very easy and straight-forward. There are essentially only three configuration points you must concern yourself with:

1. Setting the model autoload directory.
2. Configuring your database connections.
3. Setting the database connection to use for your environment.

Example:

```php
ActiveRecord\Config::initialize(function($cfg)
{
   $cfg->set_model_directory('/path/to/your/model_directory');
   $cfg->set_connections(
     array(
       'development' => 'mysql://username:password@localhost/development_database_name',
       'test' => 'mysql://username:password@localhost/test_database_name',
       'production' => 'mysql://username:password@localhost/production_database_name'
     )
   );
});
```

Alternatively (w/o the 5.3 closure):

```php
$cfg = ActiveRecord\Config::instance();
$cfg->set_model_directory('/path/to/your/model_directory');
$cfg->set_connections(
  array(
    'development' => 'mysql://username:password@localhost/development_database_name',
    'test' => 'mysql://username:password@localhost/test_database_name',
    'production' => 'mysql://username:password@localhost/production_database_name'
  )
);
```

PHP ActiveRecord will default to use your development database. For testing or production, you simply set the default
connection according to your current environment ('test' or 'production'):

```php
ActiveRecord\Config::initialize(function($cfg)
{
  $cfg->set_default_connection(your_environment);
});
```

Once you have configured these three settings you are done. ActiveRecord takes care of the rest for you.
It does not require that you map your table schema to yaml/xml files. It will query the database for this information and
cache it so that it does not make multiple calls to the database for a single schema.

## Basic CRUD ##

### Retrieve ###
These are your basic methods to find and retrieve records from your database.
See the *Finders* section for more details.

```php
$post = Post::find(1);
echo $post->title; # 'My first blog post!!'
echo $post->author_id; # 5

# also the same since it is the first record in the db
$post = Post::first();

# finding using dynamic finders
$post = Post::find_by_name('The Decider');
$post = Post::find_by_name_and_id('The Bridge Builder',100);
$post = Post::find_by_name_or_id('The Bridge Builder',100);

# finding using a conditions array
$posts = Post::find('all',array('conditions' => array('name=? or id > ?','The Bridge Builder',100)));
```

### Create ###
Here we create a new post by instantiating a new object and then invoking the save() method.

```php
$post = new Post();
$post->title = 'My first blog post!!';
$post->author_id = 5;
$post->save();
# INSERT INTO `posts` (title,author_id) VALUES('My first blog post!!', 5)
```

### Update ###
To update you would just need to find a record first and then change one of its attributes.
It keeps an array of attributes that are "dirty" (that have been modified) and so our
sql will only update the fields modified.

```php
$post = Post::find(1);
echo $post->title; # 'My first blog post!!'
$post->title = 'Some real title';
$post->save();
# UPDATE `posts` SET title='Some real title' WHERE id=1

$post->title = 'New real title';
$post->author_id = 1;
$post->save();
# UPDATE `posts` SET title='New real title', author_id=1 WHERE id=1
```

### Delete ###
Deleting a record will not *destroy* the object. This means that it will call sql to delete
the record in your database but you can still use the object if you need to.

```php
$post = Post::find(1);
$post->delete();
# DELETE FROM `posts` WHERE id=1
echo $post->title; # 'New real title'
```
